# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
#I decided to use the command collect to iterate through the array.
#I added '!' so the command would be destructive.
#I used 'is_a?' to check if each element is an integer.
#The method returns true if the element is an integer, so I added 'things_to_modify'.
#I used the .each command to iterate through the hash to modify the values.
#The 'source[key] =' changes the values.

# Release 1: Identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented. Teach your
# accountability group how to use the methods.

# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
