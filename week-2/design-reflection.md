2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
My primary goal is to have a website about me and my interests. So far I am thinking I will have pages for about me, projects I'm working on, interests/hobbies, and advice/suggestions.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience is anyone who has similar interests as I do, so mostly like mid twenties female. I want my site to be funny and also imformative. Another audience I hope to target is future employers, I hope that they will visit my site and be impressed with how organized but also interesting and ecletic and will want to hire me.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
I want the user to explore my site for any section that appeals to them and if they have further questions email me directly. I want to add a Q&A for the most common questions I encounter. 

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
An UX designer must understand how an user will enter the site, what information they will consume, and at what point they will exit. Google Analytics is a great tool that can be used to analyze data so the designer can utilize the data to improve the site so that the user will spend more time and consume more information and will desire to return.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
User experience design is very valuable since it evaluates the route users take when visiting the site and then uses this information so you can maximize and increase the time users spend on your site. In addition, in that time the information consumed will be maximized as well. Any roadblocks that are encountered by the average consumer will be addressed as well and removed.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I ran into some issues saving my site map and pasting it into sublime so that it appeared on github, those two problems by far were the most tedious and frustrating.
