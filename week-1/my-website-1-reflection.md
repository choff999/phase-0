Describe what open source means.
What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Open source just means sharing how a computer program was made and allows anyone to customize the program as they desire. 
I think Open Source works really well with projects that are non-commercial and the creator is not monetarily motivated. For instance, someone could make a basic program and then with open sourcing anyone who has more expertise can come and add to the software code and improve the overall product. 
Open Sourcing is also great for learning, for instance since I am such a beginner I would really enjoy looking at the coding on some of the major programs I use like Photoshop or iMovie. 
I do not believe Open Sourcing would work well for commercial products where companies already pay software developers to create a specific product. Having Open Sourcing and the software available for free would heavily affect their bottom line. 
Open Sourcing does feel a bit like a utopian concept, unfortunately we do not live in an utopian society and companies cannot afford to just give their software away freely.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses do alleviate some of the hesitancies around Open Source. Licenses allow you to have specific rights to your code which is very important for any company or individual attemtping to make a profit. 

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
This challenge helped solidify creating and cloning repositories for me. I had a few issues but was mainly able to clone, change, commit, and merge my document without too much time spent on referencing previous assignment guidelines. I did run into one issue with my index.html document I committed and merged it to github.com but found the document was empty. At this point I saught out outside guidance from my team lead. 

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
No I did not.
