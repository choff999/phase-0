# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
After reading through the articles and watching the videos I really enjoyed the articles on "flow" and "Tricks for Getting into the Zone" since that is something I have always struggled with. Time Boxing is when an individual or group agrees to a time period they will work towards a goal, once the time is up they will stop working and evaluate how much they accomplished. Time Boxing is definitely something I can personally use during Phase 0 since it will help be evaluate how much exactly I can get accomplished in a specific period of time. It is also helpful when I will be working with others since we will be working together remotely and most likely will not be able to just work hours on end till an assignment is complete, instead we can use timeboxing to see how much we can progress in a specific time period and then use that criteria to estimate how long it should take us to finish a project. 

Currently, I manage my time by scheduling blocks in the day I will definitely code, for instance the mornings are better for me so I like to get as much as I can done in 2-4 hour increments. My current strategy in theory will work it has just been a bit tough this first week because my schedule was atypical. I am confident once I develop a habit of coding everyday it will become like second nature and I will no longer have to stress about completing assignments on time or not. To elaborate on my plan for time management for phase 0 I will spend time on Sunday looking over my schedule for the next week and look over how many assignments are required and schedule out time all everyday so that by the time the weekend comes I can relax and not have to cram in a lot of work. 
## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
1. A shell, or terminal, executes my computer commands, it is where we will be coding. Bash is the command language operator for GNU operating system.

2. The most challenging part for me going through these materials was trying to remember the commands and what they do. 

3. I was able to get through all the commands. 

4. All of these commands are extremely important to know, I feel like they're very basic so to learn any language you have to know the basics. In my opinion "help" is one of the most important commands to know because if I do not remember the name of a command I can use it to search through my files and it helps find information that might be relevant to what I am looking for. 

5. pwd- print working directory

-ls - list directory

-mv - move a file

-cd - change directory

-../ represents the parent and current directory

-touch - makes files empty

-mkdir - make directory

-less - page through file

-rmdir - remove directory

-rm - remove a file

-help - read a manual page

### 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
To create a repository first go to your github.com profile and click on the + icon next to your avatar in the right upper corner, the text box "create a repository" should appear and click on this. Then give the repository a name, click to make it public, add an "MIT License", and them hit "Create Repository".

Whenever another username creates a repository that we would like to make a copy of we can "fork it" which basically means make our own separate copy we can work on on Github that will not affect the original. To do this we go to the repository we wish to fork and then on far right upper side there is the clickable box "fork". A prompt will appear and select to the option of forking the repo to your username. If successful Github will redirect you to your copy of the repo, which you can tell is yours because your username will be listed ahead of the repo.

If you wish to edit or work on these files you have to download it locally to your computer, or clone it. To do this you have to open Terminal on your computer and check your working directory, type pwd, to make sure you are in the correct directory where you want to work on the files. Next we need to copy the url of the your forked repo, which can be found on the right middle/lower side of the forked repo github page. Copy this url to your clipboard, some stuff should start happening and once down you should enter the command prompt "ls". The folder with the same name as the repo should appear. Now navigate into this folder with the "cd" command and open in Sublime. Next in Sublime you will see all the files and directories and you need to find the directory the file is in and open the "README.md" file. Sublime is where you read instructions and complete challenges because it is easier to read and mark in and understand the file tree.

I did not have any issues setting up my Git, Github account or creating a repository since the directions were specific and thorough. Writing up the directions for creating, forking, and cloning really helped me retain how to do this and I am confident in my ability to do it by myself.
