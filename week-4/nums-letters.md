### What does puts do?
Puts takes whatever is written directly after it and writes it on the next command line. If you write a mathematical equation it will display the results. "puts 1+2" the next line will be "3".

### What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a number that can be written without a decimal. A float is a number that can be written with a decimal.

### What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
Floats can be divided into fractions while integers cannot. For example, say I have 6 dogs and 20 dog treats, if I want to figure out how many dog treats I can give each dog to keep it even. Using floats I would tell the program to run 20/6 and I would receive an output of 3.33 treats/per dog. If I did it using integers the program would give me an output of 3 because that is the number of whole treats each dog could get.
