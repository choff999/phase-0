<!--What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
The most important thing to remember is to make sure the path is correct, we had issues with this because our file was not located where the computer thought it was.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
We spent a lot of time researching and utilizing the w3schools.com site which has almost all the css syntax we were trying to utilize.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
As you can see from above we used a bunch of different syntax.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
We used classes because we were both more familiar with them and found ids slightly more confusing. I actually thought our code was cleaner than the original source code which had them just editing the html.
