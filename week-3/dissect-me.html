		<h4>My Webpage</h4>
		My name is Caitlin Hoffman and I just moved to Brooklyn from San Francisco. I am currently in Phase-0 of Dev-Bootcamp and am really enjoying coding so far. Previously I worked in the healthcare industry and still do have a passion for medicine. I also am a huge animal lover and enjoy walking my dog Boone all over Brooklyn. Feel free to checkout my various links to other areas of this site if you wish to learn more about me personally and professionally. </section>

<!-- What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
	We used the main and section tags. We didn't use any others since my page was so short that any more tags would be gratuitious.
How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
	Doctype html, head, and body are all the main tags and within those are other tags that will define and format the webpage. The browser displays elements as they get more specific (against a more universal element).
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
	I learned about the sublime snippets, which I think are extremely benefitial when it comes to coding all day every day since after a while you will notice a trend that you will encounter the same situation and snippets allow you to create a shortcut. -->
