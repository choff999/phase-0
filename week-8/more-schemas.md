### RELEASE 6: REFLECT
- What is a one-to-one database?
	- Above I show an example of a one-to-one database, a child has only one possible (biological) mother. A one-to-one database are two tables of information that have one connection to each other.
- When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created)
	- Anytime you have two elements that can only have one connection. The state to state capital was a good example that helped me understand the concept. A state can only have one capital.
- What is a many-to-many database?
	- A many-to-many database are tables of information that have multiple relationships or connections. So one table can have ids or elements that point to two different tables.
- When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
	-I would use a many-to-many database whenever I have tables of information where elements relate to multiple elements in the other tables. For instance, if I worked a store, a customer can place an order of multiple items. And each item can be in multiple orders. 
- What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
	-It seems like very simple concepts but understanding many-to-many relationships was a bit confusing for me. I think I have a grasp on it now, especially as I saw examples of the concept.
