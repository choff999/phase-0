// Pseudocode
//Step 1: Start a for...in... loop that loops through all of the students names in votes.
//Step 2: Use an if statement to check whether property in votes matches property in voteCount
//Step 3: Have an else statement that sets value of name property to 1
//Step 4: For each position in voteCount, identify the name with highest votes, set a variable to that name, and then set the officers object position to that name to declare a winner.

// __________________________________________
// Reflection
// What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?
// When I first saw this assignment I was extremely confused and spent 2 hours looking up various javascript methods. My partner had done some research as well so when we came together we were able to complete the challenge in about an hour. Through my research and my discussion with my partner I learned that iterating over nested objects in JavaScript works when you access the correct property/value that you are looking for.
// Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?
// We knew this challenge was mainly about looping so from there we just had to design our loops so they accessed the correct information.
// What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?
// The concept of targeting elements in nested arrays was definitely solidified in this challenge.
